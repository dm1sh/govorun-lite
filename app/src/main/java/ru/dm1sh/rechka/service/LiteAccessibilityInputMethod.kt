/**
 * AccessibilityService InputMethod that tracks how many times Android has
 * fired onStartInput / onFinishInput for our binding. Used by [pasteText]
 * to detect "zombie" InputConnection state — when Android hands us a
 * fresh-looking InputConnection object that's actually bound to a destroyed
 * EditText, commitText silently succeeds but the text never appears.
 *
 * The pattern is: count startInput callbacks; before commit, await the
 * next callback with a small timeout. If we observe a fresh callback
 * within the window, the binding is alive. If we time out, the binding
 * is stale and the commit would be lost — caller falls back to the
 * accessibility-tree path instead.
 *
 * We also wrap onStartInput in try/catch for NullPointerException, which
 * the framework can throw from its own bookkeeping during binding
 * restarts on certain Android versions. The crash guard at process level
 * would catch it anyway, but absorbing it locally lets the rest of
 * the input session proceed instead of being torn down.
 *
 * Pattern adopted from Wispr Flow's WisprInputMethod (decompiled from
 * v1.8.8). Their app has been shipping this approach for two years
 * across half a million installs to handle WhatsApp/Telegram input
 * field recycling — the same root cause as our open Telegram zombie
 * binding bug.
