/**
 * Suppresses known Android framework crashes that occur on the
 * accessibility-IME pipeline thread.
 *
 * Without this, an internal NullPointerException in the system's own
 * InputMethod / AccessibilityInputMethodSession bookkeeping (during a
 * binding restart, for example) propagates up through our coroutines
 * to the default uncaught handler — which kills our entire process.
 * Android then refuses to auto-restart the accessibility service after
 * a few rapid faults, leaving the user with a "running" Settings entry
 * but a dead bubble until they manually re-toggle accessibility.
 *
 * The classes and methods listed below are the framework call sites
 * known to throw NPE on internal Android bugs we cannot fix from
 * userspace — and the StackOverflow path is the long-standing
 * AccessibilityCache recursion that hits cycle-shaped node graphs.
 *
 * Pattern adopted from Wispr Flow's AccessibilityFrameworkCrashGuard
 * (decompiled 2026-04-30 from APK v1.8.8). They've been shipping it
 * for two years across half a million installs, so the list of
 * "known" crashes here reflects what they had to add over time —
 * we inherit that list rather than rediscover it ourselves.
